The engine then partially converts the energy from the combustion to work. The engine consists of a fixed cylinder and a moving piston. The expanding combustion gases push the piston, which in turn rotates the crankshaft. Ultimately, through a system of gears in the powertrain, this motion drives the vehicle’s wheels.",

Computational photography can improve the capabilities of a camera, or introduce features that were not possible at all with film based photography, or reduce the cost or size of camera elements. Examples of computational photography include in-camera computation of digital panoramas,[6] high-dynamic-range images, and light field cameras. Light field cameras use novel optical elements to capture three dimensional scene information which can then be used to produce 3D images, enhanced depth-of-field, and selective de-focusing (or \"post focus\"). Enhanced depth-of-field reduces the need for mechanical focusing systems. All of these features use computational imaging techniques.",

As you select your dog food, make sure you choose foods rich in these nutrients.\nAs dogs lived on a diet of protein in the wild, this is the most important ingredient to look for when selecting dog food. Make sure whatever diet you choose is rich in protein. Look for brands of dog food that use real meat products, or incorporate various proteins in your dog's diet. Your dog can eat organ meat, such as heart and liver, which may be cheaper to find if you're making your dog food at home. Carbohydrates are also important to a dog's diet. You can use carbohydrates found in products like wheat, barely, corn and oats. You can also use carbs found in green vegetables like spinach or broccoli. Many commercial dog food brands contain these types of carbs for your dog. Fruits may be used to assure your dog gets enough fiber in his diet. However, check with your vet before feeding your dog fruits. Certain fruits, like grapes, may be poisonous to your dog.",

Puppies have a tendency to overeat, so it's a good idea to feed at regular times rather than free feeding. This is particularly true if your puppies are a small breed.If you have an older dog, ask your vet when to begin a senior diet. Bigger breeds of dogs need a senior diet earlier. Very large breeds will need a senior diet as early as 5 years. You will need increased amounts of certain vitamins, like Vitamin E and Beta Carotene, which you can find in some commercial dog foods. Your vet may also prescribe a supplement. Watch out for senior dog foods that contain low amounts of protein. A dog's need for protein does not change as he ages.",
