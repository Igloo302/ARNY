Computational photography can improve the capabilities of a camera, or introduce features that were not possible at all with film based photography, or reduce the cost or size of camera elements. Examples of computational photography include in-camera computation of digital panoramas,[6] high-dynamic-range images, and light field cameras. Light field cameras use novel optical elements to capture three dimensional scene information which can then be used to produce 3D images, enhanced depth-of-field, and selective de-focusing (or \"post focus\"). Enhanced depth-of-field reduces the need for mechanical focusing systems. All of these features use computational imaging techniques.",

Make sure whatever diet you choose is rich in protein. Look for brands of dog food that use real meat products, or incorporate various proteins in your dog's diet. Your dog can eat organ meat, such as heart and liver, which may be cheaper to find if you're making your dog food at home. Carbohydrates are also important to a dog's diet. You can use carbohydrates found in products like wheat, barely, corn and oats. You can also use carbs found in green vegetables like spinach or broccoli. Many commercial dog food brands contain these types of carbs for your dog. Fruits may be used to assure your dog gets enough fiber in his diet.

Arguably, a homemade diet could be healthier for your dog as the food may contain less preservative and additives. However, dogs have nutritional needs depending on their size, energy level, and age. You should consult a vet before attempting to make your dog's food at home. You want to make sure your dog is getting all the nutrients for optimal health.[5] Dogs need specific vitamins and minerals in their diet for optimal health. It's a good idea to talk over such requirements with your vet to make sure your choice of homemade dog food gets your dog these nutrients. If your dog has a specific health condition, your vet may want you to supplement your dog's diet with dietary supplements.[6] Eggs can be a good source of homemade protein for your dog, but you should never feed your dog raw eggs.",

Dogs of these ages have specific dietary needs that cannot be met with regular dog food.[7]Puppies should be fed a combination of wet and dry food. The food should be between 25 and 30% protein. Puppies have a tendency to overeat, so it's a good idea to feed at regular times rather than free feeding. This is particularly true if your puppies are a small breed.If you have an older dog, ask your vet when to begin a senior diet. Bigger breeds of dogs need a senior diet earlier. Very large breeds will need a senior diet as early as 5 years. You will need increased amounts of certain vitamins, like Vitamin E and Beta Carotene, which you can find in some commercial dog foods. Your vet may also prescribe a supplement. Watch out for senior dog foods that contain low amounts of protein. A dog's need for protein does not change as he ages.",

However, \"used\" does not mean bad - in fact, even very old cars can still be perfectly sound if well cared for. Before you reach for your wallet, though, you'll want to use your head and make sure you're not making a purchase that you'll immediately regret. First and foremost, you need to look at the engine.\n",
